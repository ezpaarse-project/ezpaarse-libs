  "readme": "# xls\n\nCurrently a parser for XLS (BIFF8) and XML (2003/2004) files.  Cleanroom implementation from the Microsoft Open Specifications.\n\n## Installation\n\nIn [node](https://www.npmjs.org/package/xlsjs):\n\n    npm install xlsjs\n\nIn the browser:\n\n    <script src=\"xls.js\"></script>\n\nIn [bower](http://bower.io/search/?q=js-xls):\n\n    bower install js-xls\n\nCDNjs automatically pulls the latest version and makes all versions available at\n<http://cdnjs.com/libraries/xls>\n\n## Optional Modules\n\nThe node version automatically requires modules for additional features.  Some of these modules are rather large in size and are only needed in special circumstances, so they do not ship with the core.  For browser use, they must be included directly:\n\n    <!-- international support from https://github.com/sheetjs/js-codepage -->\n    <script src=\"dist/cpexcel.js\"></script>\n\nAn appropriate version for each dependency is included in the dist/ directory.\n\nThe complete single-file version is generated at `dist/xls.full.min.js`\n\n## Usage\n\nSimple usage (gets the value of cell A1 of the first worksheet):\n\n    var XLS = require('xlsjs');\n    var workbook = XLS.readFile('test.xls');\n    var sheet_name_list = workbook.SheetNames;\n    var Sheet1A1 = workbook.Sheets[sheet_name_list[0]]['A1'].v;\n\nThe node version installs a binary `xls` which can read XLS files and output the contents in various formats.  The source is available at `xls.njs` in the bin directory.\n\nSee <http://oss.sheetjs.com/js-xls/> for a browser example.\n\nSome helper functions in `XLS.utils` generate different views of the sheets:\n\n- `XLS.utils.sheet_to_csv` generates CSV\n- `XLS.utils.sheet_to_row_object_array` interprets sheets as tables with a header column and generates an array of objects\n- `XLS.utils.get_formulae` generates a list of formulae\n\nFor more details:\n\n- `bin/xls.njs` is a tool for node\n- `index.html` is the live demo\n- `bits/80_xls.js` contains the logic for generating CSV and JSON from sheets\n\n## Cell Object Description\n\n`.SheetNames` is an ordered list of the sheets in the workbook\n\n`.Sheets[sheetname]` returns a data structure representing the sheet.  Each key\nthat does not start with `!` corresponds to a cell (using `A-1` notation).\n\n`.Sheets[sheetname][address]` returns the specified cell:\n\n- `.v` : the raw value of the cell\n- `.w` : the formatted text of the cell (if applicable)\n- `.t` : the type of the cell (constrained to the enumeration `ST_CellType` as documented in page 4215 of ISO/IEC 29500-1:2012(E) )\n- `.f` : the formula of the cell (if applicable)\n- `.z` : the number format string associated with the cell (if requested)\n\nFor dates, `.v` holds the raw date code from the sheet and `.w` holds the text\n\n## Options\n\nThe exported `read` and `readFile` functions accept an options argument:\n\n| Option Name | Default | Description |\n| :---------- | ------: | :---------- |\n| cellFormula | true    | Save formulae to the .f field ** |\n| cellNF      | false   | Save number format string to the .z field |\n| sheetRows   | 0       | If >0, read the first `sheetRows` rows ** |\n| bookFiles   | false   | If true, add raw files to book object ** |\n| bookProps   | false   | If true, only parse enough to get book metadata ** |\n| bookSheets  | false   | If true, only parse enough to get the sheet names |\n| password    | \"\"      | If defined and file is encrypted, use password ** |\n\n- `cellFormula` only applies to constructing XLS formulae.  XLML R1C1 formulae\n  are stored in plaintext, but XLS formulae are stored in a binary format.\n- Even if `cellNF` is false, formatted text (.w) will be generated\n- In some cases, sheets may be parsed even if `bookSheets` is false.\n- `bookSheets` and `bookProps` combine to give both sets of information\n- `bookFiles` adds a `cfb` object (XLS only)\n- `sheetRows-1` rows will be generated when looking at the JSON object output\n  (since the header row is counted as a row when parsing the data)\n- Currently only XOR encryption is supported.  Unsupported error will be thrown\n  for files employing other encryption methods.\n\n## Tested Environments\n\nTests utilize the mocha testing framework.  Travis-CI and Sauce Labs links:\n\n - <https://travis-ci.org/SheetJS/js-xls> for XLS module in node\n - <https://travis-ci.org/SheetJS/SheetJS.github.io> for XLS* modules\n - <https://saucelabs.com/u/sheetjs> for XLS* modules using Sauce Labs\n\n## Test Files\n\nTest files are housed in [another repo](https://github.com/SheetJS/test_files).\n\nRunning `make init` will refresh the `test_files` submodule and get the files.\n\n## Testing\n\n`make test` will run the node-based tests.  To run the in-browser tests, clone\n[the oss.sheetjs.com repo](https://github.com/SheetJS/SheetJS.github.io) and\nreplace the xls.js file (then fire up the browser and go to `stress.html`):\n\n```\n$ cp xls.js ../SheetJS.github.io\n$ cd ../SheetJS.github.io\n$ simplehttpserver # or \"python -mSimpleHTTPServer\" or \"serve\"\n$ open -a Chromium.app http://localhost:8000/stress.html\n```\n\n## Other Notes\n\n`CFB` refers to the Microsoft Compound File Binary Format, a container format for XLS as well as DOC and other pre-OOXML data formats.\n\nThe mechanism is split into a CFB parser (which scans through the file and produces concrete data chunks) and a Workbook parser (which does excel-specific parsing).  XML files are not processed by the CFB parser.\n\n## Contributing\n\nDue to the precarious nature of the Open Specifications Promise, it is very important to ensure code is cleanroom.  Consult CONTRIBUTING.md\n\n## XLSX/XLSM/XLSB Support\n\nXLSX/XLSM/XLSB is available in [js-xlsx](https://github.com/SheetJS/js-xlsx).\n\n## License\n\nPlease consult the attached LICENSE file for details.
