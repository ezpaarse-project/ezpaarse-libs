  "readme": "mocha-jshint\r\n------------\r\n\r\nRun jshint as Mocha tests.\r\n\r\nTo install in your node.js project as devDependency, run this command, in the root of your project\r\n```\r\nnpm install mocha-jshint --save-dev\r\n```\r\n\r\nusage\r\n-----\r\nMocha defaults to looking for your test specs in the `test` folder of your project.\r\nAdd this file as `test/jshint.spec.js` in your project, with the following content:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nrequire('mocha-jshint')();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is it you are done.\r\n\r\nTo grep only the jshint test, just do\r\n```\r\nmocha --grep jshint\r\n```\r\n\r\nconfiguring jshint\r\n------------------\r\nIn the root of your project you can add a `.jshintignore` file, where each line is a file or directory for jshint to ignore\r\nand not check for errors. (see this project for an example)\r\n\r\nAt the root of your project you can add a `.jshintrc` file, that specifies what options you want jshint to run with\r\n(see this project for an example)\r\n\r\nYou can also add a `.jshintrc` file to any subdirectory of your project, to override the .jshintrc settings in the root.\r\nFor example in this project I allow some global variables in the `test` folder. Global variables that are set when I\r\nrun mocha tests. Global variables that are only allowed to be used, in the .js files in the test folder\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n---\r\nThis module was created to:\r\n\r\n- Make adding jshint testing to a project using Mocha as easy as possible\r\n- Make it easy to piggyback on all the different Mocha reporters (dot, spec, teamcity etc) for jshint output\r\n- Make sure that you get a click-able link directly to the problem in WebStorm, when jshint fails\r\n- Make sure that there is no unnecessary noise in the test output",
