# xls

Currently a parser for XLS (BIFF8) and XML (2003/2004) files.  Cleanroom implementation from the Microsoft Open Specifications.

## Installation

In node:

    npm install xlsjs

In the browser:

    <script src="xls.js"></script>

## Usage

Simple usage (gets the value of cell A1 of sheet Sheet1):

    var XLS = require('xlsjs');
    var xls = XLS.readFile('test.xls');
    var Sheet1A1 = xls.Sheets['Sheet1']['A1'].v;

The node version installs a binary `xls2csv` which can read XLS files and output the contents in various formats.  The source is available at `xls2csv.njs` in the bin directory.

See <http://oss.sheetjs.com/js-xls/> for a browser example.

Some helper functions in `XLS.utils` generate different views of the sheets:

- `XLS.utils.sheet_to_csv` generates CSV
- `XLS.utils.sheet_to_row_object_array` interprets sheets as tables with a header column and generates an array of objects
- `XLS.utils.get_formulae` generates a list of formulae

For more details:

- `bin/xls2csv.njs` is a tool for node
- `index.html` is the live demo
- `bits/80_xls.js` contains the logic for generating CSV and JSON from sheets

## Cell Object Description

`.SheetNames` is an ordered list of the sheets in the workbook

`.Sheets[sheetname]` returns a data structure representing the sheet.  Each key
that does not start with `!` corresponds to a cell (using `A-1` notation).

`.Sheets[sheetname][address]` returns the specified cell:

- `.v` : the raw value of the cell
- `.w` : the formatted text of the cell (if applicable)
- `.t` : the type of the cell (constrained to the enumeration `ST_CellType` as documented in page 4215 of ISO/IEC 29500-1:2012(E) )
- `.f` : the formula of the cell (if applicable)
- `.z` : the number format string associated with the cell (if requested)

For dates, `.v` holds the raw date code from the sheet and `.w` holds the text

## Options

The exported `read` and `readFile` functions accept an options argument:

| Option Name | Default | Description |
| :---------- | ------: | :---------- |
| cellFormula | true    | Save formulae to the .f field ** |
| cellNF      | false   | Save number format string to the .z field |
| sheetRows   | 0       | If >0, read the first `sheetRows` rows ** |
| bookFiles   | false   | If true, add raw files to book object ** |
| bookProps   | false   | If true, only parse enough to get book metadata ** |
| bookSheets  | false   | If true, only parse enough to get the sheet names |

- `cellFormula` only applies to constructing XLS formulae.  XLML R1C1 formulae
  are stored in plaintext, but XLS formulae are stored in a binary format.
- Even if `cellNF` is false, formatted text (.w) will be generated
- In some cases, sheets may be parsed even if `bookSheets` is false.
- `bookSheets` and `bookProps` combine to give both sets of information
- `bookFiles` adds a `cfb` object (XLS only)
- `sheetRows-1` rows will be generated when looking at the JSON object output
  (since the header row is counted as a row when parsing the data)

## Other Notes

`CFB` refers to the Microsoft Compound File Binary Format, a container format for XLS as well as DOC and other pre-OOXML data formats.

The mechanism is split into a CFB parser (which scans through the file and produces concrete data chunks) and a Workbook parser (which does excel-specific parsing).  XML files are not processed by the CFB parser.

## Test Files

Test files are housed in [another repo](https://github.com/SheetJS/test_files).

Running `make init` will refresh the `test_files` submodule and get the files.

Tests utilize the mocha testing framework.  Travis-CI and Sauce Labs links:
